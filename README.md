# Computer vision and deep learning
Repository for the assignments and main project of TDT4265 Computer vision and deep learning.

# Project: using Unet2D for medcal segmentation
This project counted for 50% of the grade in the subject. It was a project over 5 weeks where the goal was to perform medical segmentation of ultrasound images and improve the model dice score.

# Assignment 1: 
In this assignment we will explore the power of gradient descent to perform binary classification with Logistic Regression. Then, we will explore multi-class classification with Softmax Regression on the MNIST dataset. Further, we will experiment with weight regularization through L2 norm, simple visualization of weights and basic visualization to present the result.

# Assignment 2:
In this assignment, we will extend the previous network to a multi-layer neural network. We derive the update rules for hidden layers by using backpropagation of the cost function. Furthermore, we experiment with several well-known ”tricks of the trade” to improve the network in both accuracy and learning speed. Finally, we will experiment with different network topologies, testing different number of hidden units, and number of hidden layers.

# Assignment 3:
In this assignment, we will perform image classification of images in the CIFAR10 dataset. This assignment will focus on pytorch. Pytorch is a deep learning framework which provides two main features: tensor functions similar to numpy that are able to run on GPUs, and it provides automatic differentiation for building and training neural networks, such that backpropagation is done automatically.
In this assignment, we will introduce training neural networks on GPU’s.

# Assignment 4:
In this assignment, we will take a look at object detection with convolutional neural networks. We use common metrics to evaluate object detection models. Then, we will take a deep dive into the SSD300 architecture, a lightweight real-time object detection model.
